# üßô  The things will become a little personal below
So if you are more interested on the tech part of this project, thank you so much, and I hope this could help you somehow in your path. Thank you so much for your time.

## üìö About the project  
This project started as a concept for a tech challenge for my second company, Envixo. The name came to me instantly, combining 'Digital' + 'Stab' from a Stabilo pen on my desk. The description given to me was very simple: a CRUD for products to register, show, delete and edit. Nothing more than that. 

At that point, I was feeling a little frustrated by having too many responsibilities, conciliating graduation with work, and never felt very confident about what I could deliver. So, I worked on it without paying much attention. In the end, I found myself with a good work in my hands. I could deliver it proudly and the role was mine. So this project always lived in a good place in my mind and my heart, and I've always wanted to revisit and put my effort and new techniques into it. after 3 years, now I have a solid foundation for enhancing my skills and knowledge, using this project as a  highlight on my portfolio.


## üôã Special Thanks
First of all, and as much as it may sound presumptuous: to myself, for never giving up when things became too hard to understand or when feelings of incapacity made me doubt myself. Even though it slowed me down, I never gave up. Once I realized that this is what I want to do, I knew that, somehow and someday, I would grab everything I deserve for continuing to fight for it.

Of course, I didn‚Äôt do this alone. Many people have passed through my life, planting seeds in this soil. I could never tend to this garden alone. To my college friends‚ÄîViviane, Leonardo, Francielle, Brenda, and many others who may make me update this section‚Äîthank you so much for never letting me give up, not just on the course but on this field in general. We have all grown so much together, and I know I‚Äôve left a mark on your lives, just as you‚Äôve left on mine.

To my best friend of all, Jos√© Viriato, who always guides me even when he doesn‚Äôt know where he‚Äôs going himself (sometimes, I think you should listen to yourself more). You‚Äôve always helped me during my perfectionist delusions and my megalomaniac plans that I never even started. Thank you so much.

To my dearest ex-coworker friends, Felipe Stival, my first boss, who gave me a love for technology. You spent so much time at the start of my journey, sharing even the simplest and most obvious things, like how to find something in a log. You filled me with praise when I created a geolocation distance code that used the curvature of the Earth as a parameter, and so much more. Always present to give advice and tips. And to Elton Campos, who was always more optimistic than I ever was. Now I‚Äôm inspired to bring that same optimism into my life and career. It‚Äôs not just about being optimistic‚Äîit‚Äôs about being realistic.

More recently, my dear Juan Almeida (you could find him on [github](https://github.com/juanrtalmeida)), who gave me the initial spark I always needed. All those simple conversations pressed a button that made me realize who I am and where I want to go. I‚Äôve embraced all the advice we shared (I confess, much of what I told you I wasn‚Äôt applying in my own life), and now I‚Äôm using it all. Thank you so much, and I can‚Äôt wait to see how much you grow too.

It‚Äôs funny because this feels like a dedication in a graduation thesis, and somehow this project feels like that to me. So, thank you to everyone who shared a piece of knowledge with me‚Äîyou made me.
